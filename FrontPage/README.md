### Installation

Don't forget to edit the settings-file!

##### Easiest: Run wih docker
```sh
$ docker build -t boaifrontend .
$ docker run -p 1339:80 boaifrontend
```
Then the service (based on nginx) is running at
```
localhost:1339
```

##### For Devs: Run locally
Just copy the contents of the files to the web host of your trust (be it nginx, apache or whatever).
Also you can open the files directly in the browser, since there is no php or whatsoever included. It's just plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript (plus libs).

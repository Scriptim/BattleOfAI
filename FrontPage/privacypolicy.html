    <title>Battle of AI Privacy Policy</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>We care about your privacy.</h1>
<h2>And we know everyone says that, but we really mean it.
    That's why this project is fully avaiable on Github.
    You can read the entire code and see, what we are doing with your data.
</h2>
<h3>What data we collect</h3>
<p>Basically what you give us. <br/>
    That includes your email address and your freely chosen username.
    We also collect your AIs moves, e.g. what moves are done in every match.
</p>
<h3>What we do with your data</h3>
<p>We save your email for notifying you about important things.
    In particular, we verify, you are human by letting you activate your email address.
    And we could need it, to send newsletters to you, if you wish so.
</p>
<h3>What data openly available</h3>
<p>Every game you play CAN BE SEEN BY EVERYONE!
    But it doesn't show your username or email,
    only your ID (which we calculate internally).
    Furthermore, there will be regular publishings of a leaderboard.
    That means others can see, how well your AI performs (only via username).
</p>
<h3>Cookies. Yummi.</h3>
<p>We use cookies to log you in and to make a session. T
    his is, because we are using a restful application
    which by design should not hold state.
    So you don't need log in on every website call.
    In depth, we save your user ID, a token and a 2nd token as a cookie.
    All of these are calculated internally and not related to you as a person in any way.
</p>
<h3>Third parties</h3>
<p>At this very moment, there are no third parties included.
    No Adsense, nothing.
    However, for development we used some open-source libraries, which you can also fully see on github
